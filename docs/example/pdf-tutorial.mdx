# Embedding PDFs into pages


:::danger[Important!]

Please view the source code of this file on
[Github](https://github.com/Redback-Operations/redback-documentation/blob/main/docs/example/pdf-tutorial.mdx) to see how it's done!

:::

## How-to

### Check your file types!

For embedding PDFs to work, please ensure:

1. It is actually a PDF file.

2. Ensure that your documentation file is a `.mdx` file **rather than** a `.md` file. This
is due to `.mdx` supporting small amounts of HTML, CSS, JS, and React (This means you can
do other cool things too if you want!).


### Hosting the file

Unfortunately due to the way this platform works, it doesn't appear possible to embed PDFs
directly from the file prior to the deployment to Github as the host platform, Docusaurus,
moves files to a different folder and gives a unique file name that does not exist before
deployment.

So, to work around this, files need to be referrenced through a third-party site. Your PDFs
can be hosted in this repo, or another Redback raw documentation repo. 

If you are hosting in this repo, please place your file in an appropriate file.
