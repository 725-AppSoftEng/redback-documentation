## Purpose and Scope of the Policy

The Cyber Security Guidelines (the Guidelines) outline cyber security standards recommended for Redback Operations. The Guidelines are intended to be read and implemented by Team Leaders and Support.

The Guidelines are prescribed for internal purposes and should be referred to as a cyber
security policy. Whilst the Guidelines are not enforceable, it is strongly encouraged that
compliance is exercised within the company. If the policy conflicts with legislation or law, the
relevant law or legislation will take precedence. The organisation is encouraged to consult the
Privacy Act 1988, the Security of Critical Infrastructure Act 2018 and the Telecommunications
(Interception and Access) Act 1979 in the formation of the company. Guidance is also sought
from the European framework of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) where the
data subjects are located in the EU.<sup>1</sup>

The company should be able to demonstrate adherence to these principles in order to protect
its systems and data from cyber threats.

## Roles and Responsibilities

This section outlines the roles and responsibilities the organisation should assign to fulfil cybersecurity requirements.

### Director Roles and Responsibilities

General Managers, Chief Information Security Officers (CISO) or Chief Cyber Security Officers (CCSO) are responsible for:

- Appointing and assigning appropriate employees with the authority to carry out particular duties outlined in the Guidelines.
- Developing and implementing a cyber security plan to consider threats, risks and vulnerabilities that affect the protection of the company’s information and systems.
- Developing a risk management process.
- Implementing policies and procedures to promote the fulfilment of the Guidelines.
- Investigation and reporting on cyber security incidents.
- Overseeing the development and implementation of an effective cybersecurity plan.

## The Essential Eight

The **Australian Cyber Security Centre** (ACSC) recommends that organisations implement eight essential mitigation strategies from the Strategies to Mitigate Cyber Security Incidents to prevent adversaries from compromising systems.

| Mitigation Strategy             | Description                                                               | Functionality |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| **Application Control** | Blocking all application by default from running on devices and manually enabling approved programs. | Prevents attackers running unapproved programs and launching malware on the system. |
| **Patch Applications** | Vulnerability scans to identify where security fixes and patches can be applied to programs with 48 hours, and where applications can be removed which are unsupported by vendors. | Prevents exploitation of unpatched applications by attackers. |
| **Microsoft Office macro settings Configuration** | Enabling Office macros where required and restricting types of macros that can be executed. | Automated commands could be executed to allow attackers to install malicious software. |
| **User Application Hardening** | Configuration of applications that interact with the web to increase security and blocking ads. | Reduces the ability for attackers to install malicious software. |
| **Restrict Administrative Privileges** | Limiting access to certain applications and data to users to ensure only certain employees can alter security settings. | Administering control over administrator accounts increases difficulties for attackers gaining access to accounts with control over the system. |
| **Patch Operating Systems** | Application of security fixes/patches for operating systems within 48 hours and analysing data to check vulnerabilities within the system | Unpatched operating systems are vulnerable to exploitation by attackers seeking to access sensitive information. |
| **Multi-Factor Authentication** | Validating the user during the login process to ensure additional checks are carried out. | Unpatched operating systems are vulnerable to exploitation by attackers seeking to access sensitive information. |
| **Regular Backups** | Regular backups of data, software and configuration settings and regular testing of the data retention process. | Ensures data can be accessed following a cyber-attack. |

## Transfer of Data

### Monitoring Data Importation and Exportation

All data transfers should be logged with information on who authorised the transfer of data, what data was transferred, where the data was transferred to or from, why the data was transferred, when the data was transferred and how the data was transferred.

Monitoring of data transfers should take place regularly to identify any unusual activities or abuse of data transfer privileges.

## Database Systems

### Communication of Database Servers and Internet of Things

All data communicated between database servers and cloud servers should be encrypted due to its susceptibility to being captured by an adversary.

### Protection of Database Contents

Users of the database should be aware of the sensitivity associated with the contents of the database. All sensitive data collected by the Orion model should be classified as such and protected through the use of access privileges to restrict database users’ ability to access, insert, modify or remove contents of the database in alignment with their role within the company.

## Managing Cyber Security Incidents

### Cyber Security Events

A system, service or network state indicating that a potential breach of security policy or unforeseen event has occurred.

### Cyber Security Incidents

An unexpected cyber security event resulting in compromised business operations or that has a likely effect of compromising business operations.

### Detecting Cyber Security Incidents

Appropriate data sources should be retained by the company and event logs should be utilised to detect and investigate cybersecurity events and cybersecurity incidents.

### Incident Management Policy

An incident management policy should be established to initiate a plan for detecting and responding to malicious activity and cover the responsibilities of the action plan, the allocation of resources, and guidelines for responding to cyber security events and cyber security incidents.

An incident management policy should be reviewed annually for compliance purposes.

### Cyber Security Incident Register

A cyber security incident register should be developed to monitor activities associated with rectifying cyber security incidents and to be utilised as a tool for future risk assessments.

A cyber security incident register should contain the following data:

- Date of the occurrence of the cyber security incident.
- Date of the discovery of the cyber security incident.
- Description of the cyber security incident.
- Response to the cyber security incident.
- The person reporting the cyber security incident.

### Reporting Cyber Security Incidents

Cyber security incidents should be reported to the CISO as soon as practicable after discovery.

Legislation obligations should be consulted to determine reporting requirements of cyber security incidents to the authorities, customers or the public.

### Reporting Cyber Security Incidents to the ACSC

Cyber security incidents should be reported to the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC).

## Responding to Cyber Security Incidents

### Handling Data Spills

In the event of a data spillage, the company should provide information about this incident to data owners and enforce access restrictions to the data.

Users should be informed about the appropriate course of action to take in regards to containing their data.

### Handling Malicious Code Infections

All infected systems should be isolated and scanned by an antivirus software to recover the data.

If the infection cannot be removed, the system should be restored to a known good backup.

### Securing Personal Information

Personal information refers to information or an opinion about an identified individual, or an
individual who is reasonably identifiable.<sup>2</sup>

Sensitive information is defined in s 6(1) of the Privacy Act 1988 (‘Privacy Act’) and includes
health information and biometric information and is afforded a higher level of privacy
protection under the APP 3, 6 and 7.

The 13 Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) are contained under s 28(1) of the Privacy Act and
provide regulations on how personal information should be handled.

- The company should take active measures to ensure personal information is secured
and consideration should be given as to whether they are permitted to retain the
information under APP 11.

- The company should take reasonable steps to ensure personal information is
protected from misuse, interference and loss, in addition to authorised access,
modification and disclosure under APP 11.1.

- The company should take reasonable steps to ensure personal information is
destroyed or de-identified where it is no longer necessary for any purpose for which
it may be used or disclosed under the APP 11.2.

- If the company provides personal information to a cloud service provider for the
purpose of storage of data and providing access to the personal information, this will
constitute the use of personal data by the company in the following circumstances:

- A binding contract exists between the entity and the provider to handle the
personal information in limited circumstances;

- The contract requires any subcontractors to agree to the obligations provided in
the contract; and

- The contract specifies that the company has control over how the information is
handled by the provider including whether the company has the right to access,
change or retrieve the information, who will have access, the security mechanisms
involved in the storage of personal information and whether the information can
be retrieved or permanently deleted by the company following termination of the
contract.

### Consent Requirements

Consent is required as authority for the company to handle consumer information in a particular way (APPs 7.3, 7.4 and 8.2(b)).

Consent should be express or implied (s 6(1)) and fulfil the four elements of consent:

1. Adequately informed;
2. Voluntary consent;
3. Current and specific consent;
4. And capacity to understand.

### De-Identification Requirements

Personal identification is de-identified ‘if the information is no longer about an
identifiable individual or an individual who is reasonably identifiable’ (s 6(1)).

Information must be de-identified by removing or altering information that identifies
an individual or is reasonably likely to and includes:

1. Removing personal identifiers such as names, address, date of birth or other
identifying information.

2. Removing or altering information that may allow an individual to be identified.

### Anonymisation, or Pseudonymisation of Data

Personal identification data must be able to be transformed in a manner that prevents
any person with unauthorised access from tracing it back to an individual.

## Health Information

‘Health information’ refers to information or an opinion that is also classified as personal
information and may include information about the health or a disability of the individual,
an individual’s expressed wishes about the future provision of health services to him or her,
or a health service provided, or to be provided, to an individual.

- Genetic information about an individual refers to information in a form that may be
predictive of the health of the individual or a genetic relative of the individual (s
6(1)).

- An APP entity will hold personal information ‘if the entity has possession or control
over a record that contains the personal information’ (s 6(1)). The term ‘record’
refers to a document or an electronic or other device (s 6(1)).

## Physical Security

This section outlines the physical protections that should be implemented to safeguard
people and assets to comply with the Work Health and Safety Act 2011.

## Notification Requirements

Where an data breach incident occurs that is likely to compromise the rights of an
individual, they must be notified immediately, and the relevant regulatory body must be
informed within 72 hours.
